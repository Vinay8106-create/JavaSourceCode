JDBC is an API (Application Programming Interface), which is used to connect the application(java application servlet with RDBMS using Drivers)
JDBC API is defined in the following packages :
-> (java.sql) and (javax.sql)

Key Classes :
-> java.sql.DriverManager
-> java.sql.Connection
-> java.sql.Statement
-> java.sql.ResultSet
-> javax.sql.DataSource (for connection pooling)


Development Process :

1)  Get a connection to DataBase
2) Create a statement Object
3) Execute SQL Query
4) Process Result Set

Step-1 : Get a connection to the DataBase
-> in order to connect a DataBase 
    - Need a connection String in the form of JDBC URL

-> Basic Syntax
    - jdbc:<driver protocol>:<driver connection details>
    example : MySql server - jdbc:odbc:DemonDSN

Failure to connect to dataBase will throw two Exceptions :
1) java.sql.SQLException : due to bad URL or credentials
2) java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: JDBC driver not in classPath

Step-2 : Create a statement Object
-> The statement Object is based on connection
    -> it will be used later to execute SQLQuery

Step-3 : execute SQLQuery
-> pass in your SQLQuery

Step-4 : Process the ResultSet
-> ResultSet is initially placed before first row
-> Method: ResultSet.next()
    -> moves forward one row
    -> return true if there are more rows to process
-> looping through a ResultSet
-> colection of methods for reading data
    -> getxxx(columnName)
    -> getxxx(columnIndex)  one-based
