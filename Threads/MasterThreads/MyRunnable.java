| `start()`       | Starts thread, calls `run()` internally.              |
| `run()`         | Code executed by the thread.                          |
| `sleep(ms)`     | Temporarily pauses thread for given milliseconds.     |
| `join()`        | Waits for another thread to finish before continuing. |
| `isAlive()`     | Checks if a thread is still running.                  |
| `yield()`       | Gives chance for other threads of equal priority.     |
| `setPriority()` | Sets priority (1â€“10).                                 |
| `interrupt()`   | Interrupts a sleeping/waiting thread.                 |
