    -> filter()                              -> collect()
    -> map()                                 -> count()
    -> flatMap()                             -> min()
    -> distinct()                            -> max()
    -> limit()                               -> forEach()
                                             -> toArray() : to copy the Objects from stream in the form of Array

-> terminal methods will always return stream of Objects
