-> to store the group of objects we use collection, and to process group og objects we use stream API
how to process ? : by using various methods or mechanisms
    -> to process a group of Objects or data in collection stream provides 2 methods :
      1 - Filter ()
      2 - Map ()

- Filter() : Filter means based upon the condition we filter the data and put the data in some other condition
- Map() : we will get each and every object from the collection, we will apply certain operations on every element and result will be stored in some other collection

NOTE : Here, we directly not process the collection , first we put the data of collection into stream API and then we process it and place it in other collection or use the data for some other purpose
      - Stream is an API, and stream will not effect the original collection / source

Some more methods of stream API :
    -> sorted() : we can sort the data after filtering or during filtering
    -> count() :
    -> collect() :
    -> distinct() : to remove duplicate objects
    -> foreach() : 
    -> min() :
    -> map() :
    
whenever we are using this stream API methods , we use lambda expressions
